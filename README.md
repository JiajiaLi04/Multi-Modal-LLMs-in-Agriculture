## 1. 💁🏽‍♀️ Introduction
Why foundation models instead of traditional deep learning models?
- 👉 **Pre-trained Knowledge.** By training on vast and diverse datasets, FMs possess a form of "general intelligence" that encompasses knowledge of the world, language, vision, and their specific training domains.
- 👉 **Fine-tuning Flexibility.** FMs demonstrate superior performance to be fine-tuned for particular tasks or datasets, saving the computational and temporal investments required to train extensive models from scratch.
- 👉 **Data Efficiency.** FMs harness their foundational knowledge, exhibiting remarkable performance even in the face of limited task-specific data, which is effective for scenarios with data scarcity issues.
